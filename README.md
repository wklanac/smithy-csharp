This is an **under construction** implementation of a C# client generator for the [Smithy IDL](https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html).

Remaining work to get to a point where I can start generating end-to-end functional code includes:
- Putting the runtime together
- DirectedCSharpCodegen implementation
- Protocol generator integration for HTTP
- SerDe integration
- Endpoint resolver
- ...probably more ;)
